This guide is the result of a group project at Noroff University College, started in 2019 and finished in 2020. The purpose of this document is to provide a walkthrough, describing how to create a connection from Alexa to various electric circuits, connected to a Raspberry Pi.

The Raspberry Pi is a small single-board computer created by the Pi Foundation, and it has a General Purpose Input Output (GPIO) interface, which can be controlled by different programs written by users.

By connecting electric circuits to the GPIO pins and using the appropriate software, it is possible to use the Amazon Alexa smart assistant to manipulate the electronic.

The intended audience for this project is IT students or anyone who wants to learn more about how IoT, Voice Activation and the Alexa Smart Assistant works.
